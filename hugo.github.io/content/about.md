title: "About Me"
---

I have over ten years of experience in data analysis, software development and project management.
I combine passion, creativity and technical excellence with high-level problem-solving, collaborative and communication skills to deliver transparent, robust and transformative intelligence.

**Data Science**: During my career I have developed an extensive expertise on all aspects of data processing and analysis. I have supervised and optimised the preparation, quality control and selection of small and large datasets by improving existing or creating new algorithms, and exploiting distributed systems for parallel computing. I have designed, tuned and validated original models to accurately describe the data while reducing systematic biases. I am very familiar with statistical methods, in particular hypothesis testing and statistical estimators. I have pioneered very diverse and high-impact analysis pipelines with novel ideas, cross-validation, enhanced visualisations, robust reproducibility and state-of-the-art techniques including machine learning.

**Collaborative Work**: I am a natural team player. I have worked in very small teams as well as with about a dozen colleagues on the same research topic. I have planned and managed the activities of multiple teams with various levels of experience. I have organised and chaired meetings, conferences and workshops with up to hundreds of participants. I have scheduled and supervised work of others effectively as well as reviewed the results of their analyses until delivery.

**Communication**: Throughout the years I have gained highly qualified written and verbal communication skills. I have written many reports, several peer-reviewed journal and feature articles, and grant proposals. I have presented the results of my work at numerous high-profile international conferences and workshops. I have been personally invited to give seminars at several institutes around Europe to discuss my research activities.
