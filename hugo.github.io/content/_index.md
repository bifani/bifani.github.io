I have over ten years of research experience in particle physics that I gained by playing central roles in diverse aspects of three international collaborations based at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). Throughout my career I have been the leading analyst of numerous high-impact and cutting-edge analyses of large datasets, and I have developed high-level problem-solving, collaborative and communication skills.
